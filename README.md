Have started the development of a page with strict rules.
Rules:
Use HTML5 tags only.
Make the webpage responsive.
Webpage should have a lazy load on the images.
Use Owl Carousel for the sliders.
Webpage should work properly on all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Microsoft Edge).
Use dummy images & dummy content wherever required.
Use pure JavaScript or jQuery for building the menu for mobile resolution.
The webpage should have a page loader that covers the entire screen and should fade after the page is loaded.
The form placement to be fixed, the section in the background will scroll.

early stages of the page has basic responsive owl carousel, navber, contact form and footer 
the carousel is set for infinte loop with auto play on.
the ui works properly on most browsers which I have installed.
lazy loader is applied on images while makes user wait till images are loaded.
on contact for have added sticky when top content is 0 so it always stays in focus and have also added a box shadow to it.
error solving took longer time and redo of stuff.

future plans is to improve UI design and add needed funtionality like search, data submittion to email, etc.
